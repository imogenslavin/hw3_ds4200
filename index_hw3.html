    <p id="main">
        I am most passionate about folk, jazz, classic rock, country rock, indie rock, and classical music. 
        I’m classically trained in violin and have been playing since I was a kid, so music has always been 
        central to my life and the way I connect with the world. I am currently a junior at Northeastern University 
        studying Data Science & Public Health, with minors in Math and Music. As part of my music minor, 
        I play in Northeastern’s orchestra, which has given me the opportunity to continue performing and to 
        stay connected to a musical community on campus. Being surrounded by musicians with different backgrounds 
        and styles has broadened the way I think about genre and the creative process. I am especially fascinated 
        by music that blends influences in subtle and unexpected ways. These combinations feel emotional and 
        familiar, yet also new. Music has always been a way for me to understand the world, express myself, and 
        connect with others, and I love discovering how different sounds, traditions, and personal histories come 
        together to form something unique and meaningful.
